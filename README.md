This repository contains all the files required for my project, creating a device which is able to detect seizures, designed for those with epilepsy who may experience seizures often. As well as detecting the seizure occuring it is also able to time how long they are and show this to the user. 

The code was extended from the original repository provided for this course, editing the original i2c_comm_master.c to produce that which can be seen here. It also contains the required pdf report as well as an image to demonstrate the wiring to the OLED display.
